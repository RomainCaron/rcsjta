/*
 * C.1 Header Definitions C.1.1 Conversation-ID A Conversation-ID header in a SIP MESSAGE request or
 * SIP INVITE request indicates the CPM Conversation Identity associated with a CPM Standalone
 * Message, CPM File Transfer, or CPM Session. A sending CPM functional component MUST include a
 * Conversation-ID header in each SIP MESSAGE request or SIP INVITE request that are associated with
 * a CPM Standalone Message, a CPM File Transfer, or a CPM Session. The sending CPM functional
 * component MUST ensure that the included CPM Conversation Identity is globally unique. Use of
 * cryptographically random identifiers ([RFC4086]) in the generation of Conversation-IDs is
 * RECOMMENDED. Conversation-IDs are case-sensitive and are simply compared byte-by-byte. Examples:
 * Conversation-ID: f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6 C.1.2 Contribution-ID A Contribution-ID
 * header in a SIP MESSAGE request or SIP INVITE request indicates the CPM Contribution Identity
 * associated with a CPM Standalone Message, CPM File Transfer, or CPM Session. A sending CPM
 * functional component MUST include a Contribution-ID header in each SIP MESSAGE request or SIP
 * INVITE request that are associated with a CPM Standalone Message, a CPM File Transfer, or a CPM
 * Session. The sending CPM functional component MUST ensure that the included CPM Contribution
 * Identity is unique within the context of the encompassing CPM Conversation. The algorithm to be
 * used for creating a Contribution-ID SHALL follow the recommendations in [draft-session-id].
 * Example: Contribution-ID: abcdef-1234-5678-90ab-cdef01234567 C.1.3 InReplyTo-Contribution-ID An
 * InReplyTo-Contribution-ID header in a SIP MESSAGE request or SIP INVITE request indicates the CPM
 * Contribution Identity associated with a CPM Standalone Message, CPM File Transfer, or CPM
 * Session, to which this request is a reply to. When a CPM User replies to a CPM Standalone
 * Message, CPM File Transfer, or CPM Session, the replying CPM Client MUST include a
 * InReplyTo-Contribution-ID header in the SIP MESSAGE request or SIP INVITE request associated with
 * the reply CPM Standalone Message, the reply CPM File Transfer or the reply CPM Session, and
 * populate it with the CPM Contribution Identity of the CPM Standalone Message, CPM File Transfer
 * or CPM Session being replied to. Example: InReplyTo-Contribution-ID:
 * 01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef
